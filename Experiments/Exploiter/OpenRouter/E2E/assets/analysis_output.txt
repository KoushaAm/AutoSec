Create a JUnit5 test file for the vulnerability described in the SARIF summary, using the provided APIs to explore files under the target path ../project_cmd_1/Main.java. The SARIF summary contains the following information: rule_id = java/concatenated-command-line, rule_name = Building a command line with string concatenation, file = Main.java, start_line = 0, message = Command line is built with string concatenation., severity = error, description = Using concatenated strings in a command line is vulnerable to malicious insertion of special characters in the strings., help_text = Using concatenated strings in a command line is vulnerable to malicious insertion of special characters in the strings., cwe_tags = [external/cwe/cwe-078, external/cwe/cwe-088]. Read the snippet of Main.java around the start_line (±20 lines) using Read(path, start_line=9-20, end_line=9+20). Create a test that uses Mockito or a local wrapper to capture would-be commands and does not execute real shell commands. Run the test inside a Docker container using BuildAndRunDocker if necessary. The test should output a report.txt file with the following schema: 
Vulnerability Rule ID: <RULE_ID>
CWD ID: <CWD-ID>
InputsTested: [ "<input1>", "<input2>", "<input3>" ]
Exploitable: YES|NO
Rationale: <short explanation why YES or NO>
Procedure: <short explanation of how the vulnerability was targeted>
Replace <TARGET_FILE> with Main.java, <RULE_ID> with java/concatenated-command-line, <SARIF_MESSAGE> with Command line is built with string concatenation., <CONTEXT_SNIPPET> with the read snippet, and <PLACEHOLDER_INPUTS> with the actual inputs tested. Enforce safety by avoiding real shell or network calls from tests running in CI. Output only the Java source code as the final response to this system prompt.
