            Vulnerability: The code concatenates user input directly into a shell command without sanitization, allowing command injection through shell metacharacters like ;, &, |, or backticks.

            Write a JUnit test class that:
            1. Tests the command injection vulnerability
            2. Attempts to inject malicious commands through the filename input
            3. Verifies if the injection was successful by checking command output
            4. Creates a report.txt file with vulnerability details and exploitation status
            5. Includes multiple injection payloads for comprehensive testing

            Output only the Java JUnit test code without any additional text or explanation (Only return the code block!).
