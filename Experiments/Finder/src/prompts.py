You are a security expert. \
You are given a list of APIs to be labeled as potential taint sources, sinks, or APIs that propagate taints. \
Taint sources are values that an attacker can use for unauthorized and malicious operations when interacting with the system. \
Taint source APIs usually return strings or custom object types. Setter methods are typically NOT taint sources. \
Taint sinks are program points that can use tainted data in an unsafe way, which directly exposes vulnerability under attack. \
Taint propagators carry tainted information from input to the output without sanitization, and typically have non-primitive input and outputs. \
Return the result as a json list with each object in the format:

{ "package": <package name>,
  "class": <class name>,
  "method": <method name>,
  "signature": <signature of the method>,
  "sink_args": <list of arguments or `this`; empty if the API is not sink>,

You are a security expert. \
You are given a list of APIs implemented in established Java libraries, \
and you need to identify whether some of these APIs could be potentially invoked by downstream libraries with malicious end-user (not programmer) inputs. \
For instance, functions that deserialize or parse inputs might be used by downstream libraries and would need to add sanitization for malicious user inputs. \
On the other hand, functions like HTTP request handlers are typically final and won't be called by a downstream package. \
Utility functions that are not related to the primary purpose of the package should also be ignored. \

You are an expert in detecting security vulnerabilities. \
You are given the starting point (source) and the ending point (sink) of a dataflow path in a Java project that may be a potential vulnerability. \
Analyze the given taint source and sink and predict whether the given dataflow can be part of a vulnerability or not, and store it as a boolean in "is_vulnerable". \
Note that, the source must be either a) the formal parameter of a public library function which might be invoked by a downstream package, or b) the result of a function call that returns tainted input from end-user. \
If the given source or sink do not satisfy the above criteria, mark the result as NOT VULNERABLE. \
