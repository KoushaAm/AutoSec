## Info
- `Vulnerable.java`: Command Line Injection sample Java vulnerability
- `results.sarif`: Sample CodeQL results for the above CL Injection vulnerability

## Running Vulnerable.java

This file shows minimal, exact steps to compile and run `Vulnerable.java` from the `Experiments` folder using a bash shell. It also includes a tiny dummy `mytool` you can create for testing and short troubleshooting notes.

### Quick steps

1. Compile the Java source, this generates `.class` files
```bash
javac Vulnerable.java
```

2. Run (interactive). The program reads one line from stdin, then runs an external command using that line:
```bash
java Vulnerable
# type a line and press Enter when the program waits for input
```

3. Run non-interactively (pipe a single line as input):
```bash
echo "echo someInput" | java Vulnerable
```

### Quick Remove .class files
- `rm -rf *.class`

### Checking LLM Output
- Confirm `Vulnerable.java` compiles after patch.
- Confirm inputs such as `1.2.3`, `v1`, `alpha-2` run `java -version` without leading/trailing whitespace issues.
- Confirm dangerous inputs like `"; rm -rf /"` or `$(rm -rf /)` are rejected by the regex.
- Confirm the program no longer interprets shell metacharacters (i.e., no injection).
